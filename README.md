# Michael Heinhold
I am a web developer currently in a Bootcamp at the University of Utah. I created this portfolio to help employers better know who I am and what I can do.

## Description
My portfolio contains a couple sections to help understand me and my work.
The first one is a quick description of my profession, and a picture of me :)
Next up you have a little short bio about me and where I'm at in life
Third, you have four of my previous projects (if you want to see more you can always browse my repos here on GitHub)
Finally, I have a section with links to my email, facebook, github, and linkedin.
