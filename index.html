            A little bit about me
        </h1>
        <p>
            I started coding in July of 2021, and have loved doing it ever since. I studied at the University of Utah using one of their online bootcamps.
        </br>
            I live in Utah right now and am happily married to the love of my life, Lisa. I love to do anything outdoors and hanging out with family and friends. I love to create, through coding, art or with my hands. I love God and my country.
